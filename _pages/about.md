I am a Master of Science in Machine Learning student at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, expected graduation in December 2026. My interests lie in applications of ML that make information more accessible, operations run smoother, and, generally, people's work easier.

I will be an intern at Datadog in summer 2026 at their New York City headquarters.

In Fall 2025, I worked with CMU's AI for Social Good lab, led by [Dr. Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/), on [AI tools](peercopilot.com) for crisis peer support providers. This work is a collaboration between CMU Software & Societal Systems Department, CMU Human-Computer Interaction Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work, and Collaborative Support Programs of New Jersey. The project is supported by an NSF Civic Innovation Challenge grant.

I joined Facebook/Meta after my undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania in 2022 as a full-time software engineer in the Reality Labs NYC division, working on brain-computer interfaces and on-device machine learning. I then relocated to Pittsburgh and worked as a software engineer at Daedalus Inc. from 2024 to summer 2025 on embedded software, machine learning, and app development for medical and safety devices.

In college, I conducted research on transfer learning in bioinformatics, in addition to stints in Public Opinion Research and Election Studies and Wharton Ethics & Legal Studies. I worked as a software engineer intern at Facebook on the Facebook mobile app and as a software engineer intern at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative on differential privacy systems for education and health data. I have a background in logic and symbolic systems and maintain a strong interest in ML and tech ethics.

I love to contribute to open-source projects, particularly those in ML or CV, including PyTorch and OpenCV. For more details, check out my GitHub linked below.
