I am a Master of Science in Machine Learning student at Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science, expected graduation in December 2026. I am interested in representation learning, deep learning, computer vision, and multimodal AI/ML. I am interested in applications of ML in science, finance, and automation.

I joined Facebook/Meta after my undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania in 2022 as a full-time software engineer in the Reality Labs NYC division, working on brain-computer interfaces and on-device machine learning. I then relocated to Pittsburgh and worked as a software engineer at Daedalus Inc. from 2024 to summer 2025 on embedded software, machine learning, and app development for medical and safety devices.

In college, I conducted research on transfer learning in bioinformatics, in addition to stints in Public Opinion Research and Election Studies and Wharton Ethics & Legal Studies. I worked as a software engineer intern at Facebook on the Facebook mobile app and as a software engineer intern at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative on differential privacy systems for education and health data. I have a background in logic and symbolic systems and maintain a strong interest in ML and tech ethics.

I love to contribute to open-source projects, particularly those in ML or CV, including PyTorch and OpenCV. For more details, check out my GitHub linked below.
